# SudokuSolver

This program uses a simple backtracking algorithm to solve any sudoku entered into the board variable. The Sudoku.py updates each cell to provide a visual
for the algorithm, but the SudokuV2.py simply solves it and displays the result. The other files were an attempt to create a callback to a c function, which
is still a work in progress.
